Preparation and Imaging History:

Cow eye, fixed and stained, was CT scanned at 39 microns (isometric voxels) using a Shimadzu InspeXio micro-CT scanner and resampled to 41 microns for GitHub Distribution.

The sample was sourced from Carolina Biological Supply, where it was fixed and stored in Carolina "Perfect" Solution. It was stained by Paul Gignac with buffered lugol's iodine (2.5% for 14 days).

Micro-CT scanning took place at the University of Arizona Nanofabrication Laboratory by Paul Gignac. Parameters included 150 kV, 120 micro-Amps, 2400 rotation steps, and 3-times image averaging. No filtration was used.

Shimadzu metadata files (.txt, .jpg) are included with the repository.

A color table file (.csv) is included with the repository.

A text file (.txt) describing the structures listed in the color table is included with the repository.
